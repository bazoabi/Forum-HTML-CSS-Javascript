This is a simple forum that was made by pure HTML CSS and Javascript

The forum interacts with "https://tarmeezacademy.com/api/v1" API as its backend, from where it fetches the users/posts/comments

The goal was to demosntrate different practices for pure HTML CSS and JS without frameworks or dedicated libraries.

Concepts demonstrated in this project such as:
- API calls
- Auth
- Bootstrap
- HTML CSS and Javascripts components
